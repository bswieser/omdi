A Java SWING program I wrote to demonstrate [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing).

I believe the UI was originally generated using [CodeWarrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWarrior).

I *think* I wrote this in the late '90s.  It is still fun today. I added a couple quirks from my playing with genetic algorithms (that really didn't do much to find better minimums.)
